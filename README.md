# Difference between a Library and Framework?
Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.
A framework inverts the control of the program. It tells the developer what they need. A library doesnâ€™t. The programmer calls the library where and when they need it.
